# FEC Data
Currently pulling candidates, committees, and contributions. Can be easily extended to hit more API's.

## To do:
- Confirm columns and run full data pull.
- Write `.sql` scripts for table DDL's.
- Write functions for dumping data to file, copying data to postgres, and backing up data in S3
